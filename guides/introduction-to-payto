<p><a href="https://www.zepto.com.au/npp/payto/">PayTo</a> is a modern digital payment method that offers a fast, easy and secure way to pay. It gives the end customers more visibility and control over their payments, thus enabling merchants and businesses to initiate real-time payments from their customer&#39;s bank accounts.</p>

<p><a href="https://nppa.com.au/payto/">NPPA</a> has developed PayTo as an alternative to traditional direct debit, where a merchant has to wait at least 3 business days to receive the funds from their end customers. With the introduction of PayTo, merchants can now directly debit their end customers in real time, 24/7, 365 days a year. ðŸš€</p>
